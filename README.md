Repository that stores scripts for hacking the Siemens S7-1200 PLC Controller. This is a school project for Equans.

## How to run the web app
We will use flask to run the web app since we just need a lightweight solution. To run flask:

- Activate your virtual environment with .venv\Scripts\activate(make sure your interpreter is set to this venv)
- then run the web server with: flask run

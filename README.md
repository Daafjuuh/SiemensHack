# SiemensHack
Repository that stores scripts for hacking the Siemens S7-1200 PLC Controller. This is a school project for Equans.

## How to run the web app
We will use flask to run the web app since we just need a lightweight solution. To run flask:

- Make a virtual environment: python -m venv .venv
- Activate your virtual environment with .venv\Scripts\activate(make sure your interpreter is set to this venv)
- Install the dependencies into your virtual environment: pip install -r requirements.txt
- then run the web server with: flask run
